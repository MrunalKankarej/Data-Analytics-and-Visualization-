# Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-

###### Description
###### This is a compilation of my analysis and visualization as part of Forage's Data Analytics and Visualization Internship Simulation (with Accenture).

## Project Overview
This analytics project aimed to provide a growing social media organization, Social Buzz, with insights regarding the categories of data posted on their platform. As part of the data analytics team, my primary goal was to complete hands-on analysis of the data and translate the requirements of the projects into actionable insights.


## Technology Implemented
1. Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning, Manipulation and Exploration
2. Microsoft PowerBI - Data Visualization


## Task Overview:

### Step 1: Understanding the Assignment:
Examined the client project brief to understand the specific questions that needed to be addressed via data analysis.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Modelling:
To prepare the data for modelling, I:
- Handled missing and out of bound (negative) values
- Reduced redundant features from dataset

To model the data, I:
- Collated all three datasets based on matching features
- Calculated reations to various categories of content
- Examined the content category with greatest positive interaction.

### Step 3: Data Visualization:
Before presenting the results to the client, I also imported the data to Microsoft PowerBI, to build develop visuals to support the insights drawn.

### Step 4: Presentation:
Communicating the insights derived from the data to the clients with a presentation pitch.


## Reflection:

From this project, I could derive that:
- Social Buzz has over 25 different categories of content
- The category with the highest sentiment score is ‘Animals’
- The category with the lowest sentiment score is ‘Public Speaking’
- The overall greatest sentiment score was generated in May 2021.
